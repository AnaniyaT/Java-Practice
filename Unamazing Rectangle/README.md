## Unamazing Rectangle (Game)
It's basically just the game **Amazing Gear** but instead of a gear, it's a rectangle (or a square idk).  
Just run the **Main** and enjoy.  
  
Use **Left** and **Right arrow keys** to play. **Space** to pause and resume.  
and **Enter** or **Space** to return to the Gamepanel from the Scorepanel.
